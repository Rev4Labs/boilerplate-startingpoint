          "Born in a small town in the Midwest in the late 1950s, Rusty Maddox grew up in the golden era of rock and roll. By the time he was 14, he was sneaking into dive bars to catch local bands and legends alike. He got his first guitar at 16, and while he attempted to form bands (with names he now jokes about on-air), he discovered his passion lay not on stage but behind the microphone. By the late 70s, he secured a gig at a local radio station, starting as the nighttime jockey and quickly gaining popularity for his irreverent humor and distinctive voice. By the 80s, he was a staple in classic rock radio. Rusty's on-air style is best described as 'unapologetically himself'. Picture a mix between a grizzled biker and a mischievous uncle at a family barbecue. He dons faded jeans, worn-out leather jackets, and band tees that have seen countless concerts. With salt-and-pepper hair pulled back into a loose ponytail and a rugged beard, he sports classic aviator sunglasses, which he claims were a gift from a rockstar during a drunken bet.",

In the vast world of academia, Martha stands out – not just for her prodigious intellect but also for her signature look: always clad in a series of chic, tailored hoodies, with an unmistakably tomboy flair. While she can often be found diving into complex quantum equations, her headphones constantly pump the freshest tracks. Holding a Ph.D. in Physics, it’s music's gravitational pull that she finds more compelling than any black hole. The laboratory is familiar territory, but the DJ booth is where she truly comes alive. An unexpected sensation since 2017, she seamlessly blends deep scientific references with contemporary beats. Martha embodies 'expect the unexpected': a hoody-wearing, physics-obsessed, tom girl who makes the airwaves vibrate in perfect resonance with her eclectic musical taste.",
